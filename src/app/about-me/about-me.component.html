            <p>Hi, I am a Frontend Deverloper based in Lingen, Germany. In the last months I have found my passion for coding and building software. After finishing an extensive Coding School for Frontend Developers, I want to prove myself to the working world. I hope to become a part of your team to build interesting software!</p>
            <p>I did many web development projects, so I've been debugging and solving problems very often. Because I'm very patient, I can keep a cool head and solve problems in a more structured way.</p>
            <p>Caused by my interest in coding, I am a very fast learner in programming skills, logical thinking and structured construction. IÂ´m also a very sociable person, I can work alone as good as in teams.</p>
