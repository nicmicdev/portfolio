            <p style="margin-bottom: 32px;">Hi, I am a Frontend Deverloper based in Lingen, Germany. In the last months
                I have found my passion for
                coding and building software. After finishing an extensive Coding School for Frontend Developers, I want
                to prove myself to the working world. I hope to become a part of your team to build interesting
                software!</p>

                <p class="p-width">I did many web development projects, so I've been debugging and solving problems very
                    often. Because I'm very patient, I can keep a cool head and solve problems in a more structured way.

                <p class="p-width">Caused by my interest in coding, I am a very fast learner in programming skills,
                    logical thinking and structured construction. IÂ´m also a very sociable person, I can work alone as
                    good as in teams.</p>
