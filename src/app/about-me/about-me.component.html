I'm Niclas Michel, a Frontend Developer with a background in Business Administration (BWL) and a strong focus on continually enhancing my technical skills. My professional journey began after completing my <b>Bachelor of Arts in Business Management</b> with a specialization in Project Management and IT.
Following my undergraduate studies, I discovered my passion for coding and decided to further my expertise in this field. As a <b>Junior Frontend Developer</b>, I applied my coding skills, teamwork abilities, and quick grasp of concepts to successfully work in this position.

<!-- My pursuit of knowledge and innovation has led me to embark on a <b>Master's program in Information Systems (Wirtschaftsinformatik)</b> at the Goethe University in Frankfurt, commencing in April 2024. <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">This endeavor will provide me with the opportunity to further refine my technical skills and establish an even deeper connection between the realms of business and IT.

I firmly believe that the fusion of business acumen and technical proficiency is invaluable in today's digital era. I look forward to continuing to craft innovative solutions and thriving in multidisciplinary teams.
